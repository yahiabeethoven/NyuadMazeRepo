Explanation of the premise of the storyworld and the concept for this particular space
This storyworld exists in the hypothetical universe which mixes NYUAD with Harry Potter. We built a large circular maze that contains several interactive objects inspired from both themes. The shape of the maze itself is actually identical to that in the third challenge of the TriWizard tournament in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which was a dark maze whose walls are made of vines and in which 3 contenders compete to reach the center to carry the trophy of the tournament. Similar to Harry Potter, the goal of the player is to make it to the center whilst carrying a cat to throw it in jail. With regards to NYUAD, we made the floor similar to the grey texture near the Welcome Center, and we used a gradient shader graph of purple and white to mimic the the top of the C2 building and the iconic violet color of NYU. The cats themselves are inspired from the real campus cats in NYUAD and they are colored as orange because it's similar to the oldest cat on campus. While many of us love the real campus cats, we thought it would be funny to create a virtual reality in which the only goal is to get rid of them by throwing them in jail. There are 4 cats (similar to campus at some point) and each are indicated by very visible colored beams to help the player make it. The idea is to go and get each of the 4 and throw them in the interactive cage, where they keep fidgeting from pain.
