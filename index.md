  This storyworld exists in the hypothetical universe which mixes NYUAD with Harry Potter. We built a large circular maze that contains several interactive objects inspired from both themes. The shape of the maze itself is actually identical to that in the third challenge of the TriWizard tournament in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which was a dark maze whose walls are made of vines and in which 3 contenders compete to reach the center to carry the trophy of the tournament. Similar to Harry Potter, the goal of the player is to make it to the center whilst carrying a cat to throw it in jail. With regards to NYUAD, we made the floor similar to the grey texture near the Welcome Center, and we used a gradient shader graph of purple and white to mimic the the top of the C2 building and the iconic violet color of NYU. The cats themselves are inspired from the real campus cats in NYUAD and they are colored as orange because it's similar to the oldest cat on campus. While many of us love the real campus cats, we thought it would be funny to create a virtual reality in which the only goal is to get rid of them by throwing them in jail. There are 4 cats (similar to campus at some point) and each are indicated by very visible colored beams to help the player make it. The idea is to go and get each of the 4 and throw them in the interactive cage, where they keep fidgeting from pain. 

  Although we had a lot more interactivity and details in mind such as having another obstacle of a monster fighting the player and them killing it with a mighty sword such as that of Gryffindor in Harry Potter, we were faced with numerous bugs and time constraints and so were not able to complete this feature. Other features we also wanted include having more dialogue for the user to explain what exactly they should be doing, possibly a large timer on the top left to encourage the player to do their best to complete the maze quickly before the other "competitors", a feature of throwing the cats with a large force to not have to enter the cage in order to throw them, and also some sort of indication that the game has ended once the player has thrown all 4 cats in the jail. We are aware that these features could have enhanced the experience significantly, but we were more focused on ensuring the fundamental aspects of the game are perfected and work fully. Instead of making unnecessary tweaks to improve the experience slightly, we prioritized fulfilling the essential requirements of this project as outlined by the professor before further development. The past week was quite intense because both Ziyad and myself faced technical difficulties that hindered our progress. In my case, my laptop was not building to the Oculus Quest 2 device and the Edit Lab has classes on a regular basis so I was not able to complete the Interactions Lab until much later, which really made it very difficult for me to be able to take our project a step further to enhance its creativity and immersiveness. In the case of Ziyad, he also was not able to connect the USB-C port to his computer through any adapter which prevented him from being able to work from his personal computer and having to work only in the Edit Lab. These issues really made collaboration a big issue for us and limited the time we could actually spend working on the project. Nevertheless, we are still very happy with our project and we believe it fulfilled its purpose by being an interactive and funny experience.

Overall, developing our first virtual reality application is a very exciting and fun experience to go through! It took us a long time get the hang of XR interactions and how to implement the basic features of such an application initially, but eventually we understood how the process works. We really enjoyed interactive storytelling and we're looking forward to integrating our knowledge in this aspect with more advanced character animation as well in the future.
